# ShowTime
Build a program that sends notifications about show times for potentially interesting movies
playing at your favorite cinema. The concept of an 'interesting movie' can be derived using
machine learning (if you watch enough movies to have good training data), or a handcrafted
algorithm. Feel free to use the Open Movie Database (http://www.omdbapi.com/), along with
an HTML parser called BeautifulSoup
(https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to build a program that sends
alerts for movies, example with a rating of 7.0 or higher.
